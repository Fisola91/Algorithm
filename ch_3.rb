## RECURSION => where a function calls itself.
# A coding technique used in many algorithms
# There is no performance benefit of recursion

#Note: Leigh Caldwell noted that Loops may achieve a performance gain for your program.
#Recursion may achieve a performance gain for your programmer


#BASE CASE AND RECURSIVE CASE

# When you write a recursive function, you have to tell it when to STOP.
# That is why every recursive functionhas two parts:
# (1) The base case => When function doesn't call itself


# (2) The recursive case => When function calls itself


# LOOP
def countdown(i)
  puts i
  while i > 0
    puts i -= 1
  end
end


# RECURSION
def countdown(i)
  if i == 0 # base case => important for stopping recursion
    i
  else
    puts i
    countdown(i-1) # Recursive case
  end
end
puts countdown(3)

## CALL STACK => used to save variables for multiple functions
