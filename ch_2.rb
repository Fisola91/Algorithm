## SELECTION SORT

# A lot of Algorithms work if your data is sorted.



# arrays and lists are  used to store multiple items.
# There is no one right way to store items for every use case.



## LINKED LISTS
# Each item stores the address of the next item in the list.
# As a result, you can't read the last item in a linked list.
# You never have to move your items.
# If there is space in memory, you have space for your linked list.
# They are so much better at insert
# They are great for reading items one at a time.
# But not good for reading item systematically

## ARRAY
# They are great for reading items.
